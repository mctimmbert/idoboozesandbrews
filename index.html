        <p class="review-card">“100/10 stars! Sarah was the absolute best human being to work with. She made the process of getting a bartender for our wedding easy and effortless. Over the wedding planning process I received several check ins, always had questions answered and she reached out first to finalize plans beforehand. Which with most of my other vendors it was me reaching out to them. It really showed how much they cared. Day of they arrived early, set up, and were the best bartenders a bride could ask for. We had a tray service champagne toast that they offered to do for us and it was lovely. Seriously could not have asked for better bartenders! We were honored to have you as a part of our special day! Thanks so much!”

        <p class="review-card">“We had a seamless experience with I Do Boozes & Brews! Upon contacting her they were quick to reply and made things really easy with options! The day of our event they were set up, ready to go, and offering help to others around! Her bar display was a great professional touch! We will definitely be using their services for future events!”

        <p class="review-card">“Thank you so much for helping to make our Daughters wedding a success! Our pair of bartenders arrived at the wedding venue early, even after stopping to grab ice last minute. Sarah was very professional, knowledgeable, and familiar with the venue (bonus) Both bartenders were outgoing, friendly, & respectful. They kept family and friends smiling all night! Even after the sparkler send off for Bride & Groom, they were providing clean up and heavy lifting a job well done! We say “CHEERS” to your help in throwing an unforgettable memory of a lifetime! Many Thanks to I DO BOOZES & BREWS!!”

        <p class="review-card">“Sarah and Skye were so wonderful to work with. They made the process so easy and were so professional the day of our wedding! They even provided ice and cups for us, and made the bartending process easy! They set up and cleaned up on their own, and we were totally stress free! They handled everything and more that we needed and we are so thankful for them! If we need bartending services in the future we will definitely be calling them first!”

        <p class="review-card">“I would recommend them to anyone! We had a larger wedding and there was never a line, everyone was served quickly, and they kept the positive and exciting attitude going. Throughout wedding planning Sarah would check in, was quick to respond, had great suggestions, and was overall AMAZING!! Definitely use I Do Boozes and Brews!”
